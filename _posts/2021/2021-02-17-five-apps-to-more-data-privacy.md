Bill Evanina, former Director of the U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center [claimed](https://www.ibtimes.com/china-has-stolen-personal-data-80-american-adults-report-3134525) that China may have stolen personal data from 80% of Americans. Edward Snowden, former technical assistant for the CIA, claimed the U.S. government was bulk harvesting data on American citizens. Cyber security threats can be foreign and domestic. Anyone can increase their data-privacy as simple as downloading a few apps. Every engagement through your phone is contributing data to a data-base. Even when your phone is sitting idle, data is being collected by someone tracking your location and creating a consumer profile to profit off your behavior. So, let's reduce our data foot-print with a few apps.

[Telegram](https://telegram.org/) & [Signal](https://www.signal.org/) 

Uninstall WhatsApp, stop using normal SMS texting, and use these privacy orientated messaging apps that allow the same-old features any other messaging app offers. If you can convince your family and friends to get onboard using more secure communication apps, then that may make most of your messages and calls more private. Consider moving your family text-groups on these privacy focused apps.

[ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) & [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/)

Stop using Gmail, Yahoo, or Outlook. These are constantly under algorithms that are creeping your emails. An encrypted email service provider will dramatically improve your privacy as emails are used for your user accounts throughout the internet and can contain sensative information. Do you want your email provider to know who you bank with? Where you have accounts? Use end-to-end encrypted email.

[ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/)

All your internet connected devices can help hide your internet usage through a VPN. These tools are not rocket science, they're very easy to use and they can automatically run in the background of your device.

[Brave Browser](https://brave.com/)

If you want the Google Chrome browsing experience while having more privacy and better performance, then use Brave. Brave is based on Google Chrome, but its faster and more privacy centric. It does this by blocking ads by default and you can save hours of your time from block ads and trackers.

[Mega](https://mega.nz/login)

Mega is a cloud storage provider, much like Google Drive, but has end-to-end encryption by default. That means Mega doesn't spy on you and run algorithms through your family photos.
