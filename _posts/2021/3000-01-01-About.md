I'm a Developer Relations Specialist based in the USA. I am a cryptocurrency advocate and passionate about building communities, open-source, and supporting developers. I've been a contributor to cryptocurrency-blockchain projects since 2016 as a miner, developer, content creator, and overall thrive to be a productive citizen of the communities I've been blessed to be a part of.
